# sublimetext_3_configuration
My personal configuration and preference to sublime text 3. So do not use this and I am not liabiable for anything. I'm known to break a lot of stuff.

- [ ] Create own theme.
- [ ] Possibility add some more keybindings shortcut.
- [ ] Add some more perferences.
- [ ] Maybe create something out of the ordinary.
